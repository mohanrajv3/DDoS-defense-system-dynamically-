# DDos-Defense-Security-using-Multi-Layed-Approach

Inspired by the human immune system, this multi-layered defense model mimics adaptive immunity by identifying anomalies, learning attack patterns, and responding dynamically. It leverages machine learning for anomaly detection, reinforcement learning for adaptive response, and blockchain for secure, tamper-proof threat logging, ensuring robust protection against evolving DDoS attacks.
